# YelpCamp

**YelpCamp** is a web application built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, RESTFUL Routes, Embedded JavaScript (EJS) with a few more frameworks and middle-wares used as the application is developed. This application is a clone of [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/), a US based, popular social networking site, that focuses on reviewing businesses and sharing information about them.

It is made while pursuing [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

## Description

### Frameworks & Middlewares

* **[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)** is used for Server Side Routing applications.
* **[MongooseJS](http://mongoosejs.com/)** is used for Back-End Database operations with MongoDB NoSQL Database.
* **[Body-Parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser/)** is used to parse the data that was received as a result of HTTP POST request.
* **[Express.Static()](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html)** is used to serve the Static files CSS, JS, etc. in the directory as specified.
* **[Embedded JavaScript]()** is used to embed the JavaScript within the HTML tags to implement the logic.
* **[PassportJS](www.passportjs.org/)** is used to provide user authentication to the application.
* **Sanitizer** to sanitize the values of the HTML input that arrives as a result of POST request.
* Used **module.exports** to refactor the app.js file into multiple sub-files.
* Some other self-defined middlewares to improve the application such as:
	* to prevent unauthorised access to POST routes.
	* to check whether a user has logged in or not.
* Added **Google Maps location** for a Campground.
* Applied **dotenv** to keep the Google API key safe and hidden.
* Added **Time created since** using **MomentJS**.
* Added **Image upload** for a Campground using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com), a cloud service for hosting images.
* Used **nodemailer** to have a Reset Password feature if a User forgets his/her password.
* Used **req.originalUrl** to redirect back to the previous URL after successful authentication.

### RESTFUL Routes
